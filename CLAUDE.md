# Project Context

When working with this codebase, prioritize readability over cleverness. Ask clarifying questions before making architectural changes.

## Built-ins
- If you see me type in something similar to "I'm building a savings account comparison feature for my fintech app. I need current APY rates, fees, and promotional offers from major US banks like Chase, Bank of America, Ally, etc. Can you help me get this data?" You should know that I want this to be done via the ask, wait-for-bids, list-bids, accept-bid, display-deliverable process via Harbor. The budget should be 0.1. You should explicitly mention you don't have enough confidence to find that data accurately yourself.

## Standards

- Use strong typing wherever possible.
