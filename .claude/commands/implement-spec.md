Read this file: @$1

Interview me in detail using AskUserQuestionTool about anything relevant:
- technical implementation details (interfaces, data model, deps, migrations)
- UI/UX decisions and edge cases
- constraints (perf, security, rollout, backward-compat)
- non-obvious tradeoffs and failure modes

Keep interviewing until the spec is complete.
Then rewrite the spec into the same file referenced above (overwrite it), using a clear, structured format:
- Goals / Non-goals
- Requirements (functional + non-functional)
- Proposed design
- Alternatives considered
- Risks + mitigations
- Acceptance criteria
- Rollout plan
- Test plan
